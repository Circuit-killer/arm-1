\section{Group Organisation}

We wanted to make sure that everyone was contributing to the project, so we always had 2 or 3 computers running editing different parts of the project and then committing and pushing the changes once the rest of the group was informed of the change and agreed with the improvements. We also however found ourselves quite often gathered around 1 computer all discussing the problem and giving our individual ideas to try to come up with the best implementation of a certain function or part of a file. Since different members of the group understood better or were more proficient at certain aspects of C or the project as a whole the latter approach tended to suit us very well as then it made sure that everyone understood what was happening in all parts of the project and so could therefore contribute more evenly.
